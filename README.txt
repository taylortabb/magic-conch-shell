# A Real Magic Conch Shell

Ever wanted a Magic Conch Shell of your own? Follow these instructions to build a Magic Conch Shell of your own.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, as well as get the required hardware swt up to support the project.

### Hardware

The hardware for this project is pretty simple, you'll just need the parts below:


* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)
* [Pimorini Speaker pHat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/speaker-phat) - This is the compact speaker we'll use to let the shell speak
* A tiny USB microphone - This is a microphone. We need a tiny one so it fits in a Conch shell.
* A Conch Shell - A conch shell can be bought online, but if you're lucky enough to live near a beach, you might be able to find your own (NEVER collect a shell with a living organism in it! Queen Conch are susceptible to over-fishing, habitat degrdation, and deserve happy long lives. Check with your local laws before taking a shell from the beach.) Or consider 3D printing one yourself.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
